                        <h4>Rizal's Legacy and the Question of Retraction</h4>
                        <p><strong>Jos� Rizal</strong> is identified as a hero of the revolution for his writings that centered on <span class="emphasis">ending colonialism</span> and liberating Filipino minds to contribute to the creation of the Filipino nation. A great volume of Rizal's lifework was committed to this end, particularly his most influential novels, <span class="key-term">Noli Me Tangere</span> and <span class="key-term">El Filibusterismo</span>. His essays vilified not the Catholic religion itself, but the <span class="emphasis">friars</span>, who were seen as the main agents of injustice in Philippine society during the Spanish colonial period.</p>
                        <p>It is understandable, therefore, that any piece of writing attributed to Rizal that <span class="emphasis">recants everything he wrote</span> against the friars and the Catholic Church in the Philippines could deal heavy damage to his image as a prominent Filipino revolutionary. Such a document purportedly exists and was allegedly signed by Rizal a few hours before his <span class="highlight">execution on December 30, 1896</span>. This document, commonly referred to as <span class="key-term">"The Retraction,"</span> declares Rizal's belief in the Catholic faith and retracts everything he wrote against the Church.</p>

                        <p>There are <strong>four different iterations</strong> of the text of this retraction:</p>

                        <h4>The Balaguer Testimony: Supporting the Retraction</h4>
                        <p>Doubts surrounding the authenticity of the retraction document abound, especially because only one eyewitness account of the writing of the document initially existed�that of the Jesuit friar <strong>Fr. Vicente Balaguer</strong>. According to his testimony, Rizal <span class="emphasis\">woke up several times, confessed four times, attended Mass, received Communion, and prayed the rosary</span>, all of which appeared out of character based on Rizal's known beliefs and writings.</p>
                        <p>Despite these doubts, Balaguer's account has been used to argue for the <span class="emphasis\">authenticity of the retraction</span>, as it was long considered the only "primary" eyewitness testimony claiming that Rizal wrote and signed such a document.</p>

                        <h4>?? The Cuerpo de Vigilancia Report: Questioning Balaguer's Account</h4>
                        <p>Another eyewitness account surfaced in <span class="highlight\">2016</span> through the research of <strong>Professor Rene R. Escalante</strong>. In his research, documents from the <span class="key-term\">Cuerpo de Vigilancia</span> included a report on the last hours of Rizal, written by <strong>Federico Moreno</strong>. This report details the statements of the Cuerpo de Vigilancia regarding Rizal's final moments.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"At approximately 9, the Assistant of the Plaza, Se�or Maure, asked Rizal if he wanted anything. He replied that at the moment he only wanted a prayer book... Se�or Andrade left death row at 10 and Rizal spoke for a long while with the Jesuit fathers, March and Vilaclara, regarding religious matters... It appears that these two <span class="emphasis\">presented him with a prepared retraction on his life and deeds that he refused to sign</span>. They argued about the matter until 12:30..."</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This account corroborates the existence of a retraction document, thereby giving it additional credence. However, <span class="emphasis\">Fr. Balaguer was not mentioned anywhere in this account</span>, which renders him a secondary source to the actual writing of the document rather than a direct eyewitness.</p>

                            <strong>Central Debate:</strong> Did Rizal voluntarily sign, sign under duress, or did the Spanish fabricate the entire document?
                        </div>
                        <p>The retraction of Rizal remains a <span class="emphasis">historical controversy to this day</span>. The questions surrounding this document include:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; color: #51513E; line-height: 1.8;">
                            <li>Why did it take <span class="highlight">39 years</span> for the "original" document to surface?</li>
                            <li>Why are there <span class="emphasis">four different versions</span> of the same document?</li>
                            <li>Why was <span class="emphasis">Fr. Balaguer not mentioned</span> in the official Cuerpo de Vigilancia report?</li>
                            <li>Did Rizal initially <span class="emphasis">refuse to sign</span> a prepared retraction?</li>

                        <h4>Rizal's Historical Significance Despite the Retraction Controversy</h4>
                        <p>Many scholars, however, agree that the existence of such a document <span class="emphasis">does not tarnish Rizal's heroism</span>. His relevance to Filipinos remained solidified, and his ideas continued to inspire the revolutionary movement that eventually resulted in <span class="key-term">Philippine independence in 1898</span>.</p>
                        <p>Whether authentic or not, the retraction document cannot erase the profound impact of Rizal's <span class="key-term">Noli Me Tangere</span> and <span class="key-term">El Filibusterismo</span>, which awakened nationalist consciousness among Filipinos and became ideological foundations for the Philippine Revolution.</p>

                        <h4>Rizal's Connection to the Katipunan</h4>
                        <p>Rizal's connection to the <span class="key-term">Katipunan</span> is <span class="emphasis">undeniable</span>. In fact, the precursor of the Katipunan as an organization was <span class="key-term">La Liga Filipina</span>, which <strong>Rizal founded</strong>. <strong>Andrs Bonifacio</strong> was among its members. La Liga Filipina, however, was short-lived, as the Spanish authorities <span class="emphasis">exiled Rizal to Dapitan</span> shortly after its establishment on July 7, 1892.</p>
                        <p>Following Rizal's exile, former members decided to band together and establish the <span class="key-term">Katipunan</span> just a few days later. Although Rizal was not officially part of the Katipunan, the Katipuneros showed great appreciation for his work and shared the same goals of national liberation. Out of the 28 members of the Katipunan's leadership, known as the <span class="key-term">Kataas-taasang Sanggunian ng Katipunan</span>, from 1892 to 1896, <strong>13 were former members of La Liga Filipina</strong>. Katipuneros even used Rizal's name as a <span class="emphasis">password within the organization</span>.</p>

                        <div class="fact-callout conclusion-box">
                            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The authenticity of the retraction is debated, but Rizal's influence on Philippine nationalism is <span class="emphasis">undeniable and unchangeable</span>.
                        </div>
                        <p>Whether Rizal retracted or not, his fundamental contributions to Philippine history remain unquestioned. His novels, essays, and ideas <span class="emphasis">inspired generations</span> of Filipinos to pursue independence and national identity. The retraction controversy, rather than diminishing his legacy, exemplifies the <span class="emphasis">complex and contested nature of historical truth</span>a reminder that primary sources must be critically analyzed and multiple perspectives considered when reconstructing the past.</p>
