                        <h4>Historical Context: Beyond the "Firsts"</h4>
                        <p>The obsession with identifying historical <span class="key-term">"firsts"</span> often leads to oversimplification of complex events. However, this case study transcends mere trivia. Rather than focusing on the symbolic prestige of the location, we examine the <span class="emphasis">First Catholic Mass as a historiographical exercise</span>—demonstrating how historians use <span class="emphasis">evidence, compare sources, and apply critical interpretation</span> in reconstructing the past. The question of where the Mass occurred reveals the <span class="emphasis">evolving nature of historical scholarship</span> and the importance of rigorous source analysis.</p>

                        <h4>The Three-Century Butuan Claim</h4>
                        <p>For more than <span class="highlight">three centuries</span>, Butuan was accepted as the site of the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines. This widespread belief culminated in the erection of a <span class="emphasis">monument in 1872</span> near the Agusan River, commemorating the arrival of Magellan's expedition and the celebration of Mass on <span class="highlight">April 8, 1521</span>. The Butuan claim was based largely on an <span class="emphasis">elementary reading of primary sources</span> that was accepted and repeated in historical narratives.</p>
                        <p>However, as historical research methods improved toward the <span class="emphasis">end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century</span>, scholars began to reexamine these sources more critically. This reassessment challenged the long-accepted interpretation and opened a significant debate between <span class="key-term">Butuan and Limasawa</span> as the possible site of the first Mass.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h4>Primary Sources: The Foundation of the Debate</h4>
                        <p>Historians rely on only <span class="highlight">two major primary sources</span> to determine the site of the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines:</p>

                        <div class="fact-callout">
                            <strong>Source 2:</strong> <span class="key-term">Antonio Pigafetta's Account</span> — The most detailed narrative, "Primo viaggio intorno al mondo" (First Voyage Around the World), providing eyewitness testimony of events and activities during the voyage.
                        </div>
                        <p>Both sources were written by <span class="emphasis">members of Magellan's expedition who witnessed the events firsthand</span>. Analyzing these accounts provides crucial insights into where the Mass actually occurred.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h4>Albo's Geographical Evidence</h4>
                        <p>Francisco Albo's log describes the expedition's movement from the Ladrones (Marianas) to Suluan, then to Homonhon, and later to an island called <span class="key-term">Mazava</span>, located at approximately <span class="highlight">9°40' North latitude</span>. In Mazava, Albo noted the <span class="emphasis">planting of a cross on a mountain-top</span> from which three islands to the west and southwest could be seen.</p>
                        <p>Critically, Albo's geographical descriptions <span class="emphasis">strongly correspond to the location of Limasawa</span>, situated at the southern tip of Leyte. His account does <span class="emphasis">not align with Butuan's riverine geography</span>, as <span class="key-term">no river was mentioned</span> in relation to Mazava—a striking omission for a site as geographically significant as Butuan.</p>

                        <p>Antonio Pigafetta provided the most detailed narrative of the expedition's movements. He documented that the expedition traveled from <span class="key-term">Homonhon</span> (reached on <span class="highlight">March 17, 1521</span>) westward toward Leyte, then southward, and finally to an island called <span class="key-term">Mazaua</span> on <span class="highlight">March 28, 1521</span> (Holy Thursday).</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"It is twenty-five leagues from the Acquada, and is called Mazaua. It lies at a latitude of nine and two-thirds degrees towards the Arctic Pole (i.e., North)."</p>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Pigafetta's geographical descriptions—particularly the <span class="emphasis">island setting, coastal features, and proximity to Leyte and Cebu</span>—corroborate Albo's log and further support the identification of Mazaua as <span class="key-term">Limasawa</span>.</p>

                        <p>Pigafetta provided crucial details about the celebration of the Mass. On <span class="highlight">Sunday, March 31, 1521 (Easter Sunday)</span>, Magellan sent a priest ashore in the early morning to prepare for the celebration. Later that day:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Early in the morning of Sunday, the last of March and Easter day, Magellan sent the priest ashore with some men to prepare for the Mass. Later in the morning Magellan landed with some fifty men and Mass was celebrated, after which a cross was venerated. In the afternoon they returned ashore to plant the cross on the summit of the highest hill. In attendance both at the Mass and at the planting of the cross were the king of Mazaua and the king of Butuan."</p>

                        <p>This detailed description <span class="emphasis">firmly situates the celebration of the Mass on an island</span>, further weakening the claim that it occurred in Butuan, which was a settlement located <span class="key-term">along a river</span>.</p>

                        <h4>Critical Analysis: The River Question</h4>
                        <div class="fact-callout importance-high">
                            <strong>Key Evidence:</strong> The <span class="emphasis">absence of any mention of a river</span> in Pigafetta's account of Mazaua undermines the Butuan claim. Butuan was a riverine settlement along the Agusan River—a geographical feature too significant to overlook.
                        </div>
                        <p>Jesuit historian <strong>Miguel A. Bernad</strong>, in his work "Butuan or Limasawa? The Site of the First Mass in the Philippines: A Reexamination of Evidence" (1981), emphasized a critical omission in Pigafetta's account that undermines the Butuan hypothesis. Pigafetta <span class="emphasis">made no reference to a river</span> in describing Mazaua or the activities there. This silence is particularly significant because:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; color: #51513E; line-height: 1.8;">
                            <li>Butuan's defining geographical feature was the <span class="key-term">Agusan River</span>, where it was situated</li>
                            <li>A riverine environment would have been <span class="emphasis">difficult for an eyewitness to overlook</span></li>
                            <li>Pigafetta later described a <span class="emphasis">river journey to Mindanao after Magellan's death</span>, demonstrating that he was attentive to riverine environments when present</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This contrast strongly supports the conclusion that <span class="key-term">Mazaua was not Butuan but Limasawa</span>.</p>

                        <h4>Conclusion: Methodology Over Tradition</h4>
                        <div class="fact-callout conclusion-box">
                            <strong>Central Insight:</strong> The question of where the first Catholic Mass occurred demonstrates that <span class="emphasis">history is not fixed by tradition but refined through disciplined analysis of evidence</span>.
                        </div>
                        <p>While Butuan was long accepted as the site due to tradition and commemoration, <span class="emphasis">careful reexamination of primary sources</span>—particularly the accounts of Francisco Albo and Antonio Pigafetta—demonstrates that <span class="key-term">Limasawa</span> more accurately fits the geographical and narrative evidence. The shift from Butuan to Limasawa as the scholarly consensus illustrates the <span class="emphasis">evolving nature of historical knowledge</span>.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, this case study shows that history is not merely about celebrating "firsts" or identifying locations. Instead, it is about <span class="emphasis">understanding how historical knowledge is constructed, challenged, and refined</span> through disciplined analysis of evidence. The First Catholic Mass in the Philippines remains a powerful moment in Philippine history—and examining where it took place teaches us how to be better historians.</p>
